## Work on a new feature
---
Be placed on `dev` branch:
```
git checkout dev
```

Create a new branch to work on a new feature :
```
git checkout -b feat/feature-name>
```

### ! Name branch !
❌ ~~CamelCase ou pascalCase~~
✅ **snake_case**

 ---
## Commits name:

- `config:` When configuration is changed
- `feat:` When adding new feature or new styles
- `fix:` When bug is resolved
- `doc:` When documentation is update
- `refacto:` When refactoring

Then explain in a few words the work done (mention the components/files on which you worked).

Once the development is finished and committed, we recover any modifications:

```
git pull origin feat/<name-feature>
```

We resolve conflicts.

Once the conflicts are resolved, we make a pull request on **GitHub**, from the `feat/<feature-name>` branch in the `dev` branch.

Once the features have been collected in the `dev` branch and the bugs fixed,
we make a pull request on **GitHub**, from the `dev` branch in the `prod` branch.
